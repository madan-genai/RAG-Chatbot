# RAG AI Agent

This repository contains a simple **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** chatbot built with Python, LangChain, Groq LLM, and Streamlit. 

The application allows users to upload a PDF document and then ask questions about the contents. Answers are generated by retrieving relevant text chunks from the uploaded document and feeding them to the Groq LLM.

## Features

- Upload PDF files via Streamlit interface
- Split documents into searchable chunks using LangChain text splitters
- Build a FAISS vector store for efficient retrieval
- Query the vector store and feed results to a Groq language model
- Simple prompt template ensuring the model only uses provided context

## Requirements

Dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. Key libraries include:

- `streamlit` – Web UI
- `langchain` and related packages for document loading, splitting, embeddings, and chaining
- `git+https://github.com/groqai/langchain-groq` (Groq LLM integration)
- `python-dotenv` to load environment variables

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/madan-genai/madan-genai.git
   cd "RAG AI Agent"   # or wherever you cloned it
   ```

2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   .\.venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows PowerShell
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add any required API keys (e.g., GROQ_API_KEY).

## Usage

Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

- Upload a PDF document when prompted
- Enter questions in the text box; the assistant will respond using context from the document

## Project Structure

- `app.py` – Streamlit frontend and orchestration
- `rag_pipeline.py` – Core RAG logic (vectorstore creation and chain building)
- `requirements.txt` – Python package dependencies

## Notes

- `.env` is gitignored for security reasons. Do **not** commit sensitive API keys.
- This project is a lightweight example and can be extended with database storage, caching, or additional retrieval strategies.
